MY LIFE JOURNEY IN TECH

Tech has always been my source of interest ever since i was a kid. I used to think tech is a means or avenue to express myself. I remembered when i sneak out to my neighbours home to play with corel draw on their desktop computer.
I wanted to study software engineering but i couldn't because of some circumstances, i ended up studying a business course in the university. Then, along the line i ventured into music production where i became a digital modern producer, using softwares, like daws and plugins to make music. I got so experienced in production that i started doing it commercially. 
I also learned corel draw and microsoft office to the fullest, i even design some graphic works for my school. Going on, i learned autocad to start designing building plans and elevations. That was because my dad is a contractor. I could remember after learning the autocad, i designed two building plans for my dad which he built houses upon. 
Going on, I tried learning PS for graphic works because corel draw was not enough. I couldn't finish up making me not to have full experience of PS.
I also tried Hacking that is legal for cyber security, i came just a halfway. I really want to be part of those that will shake the world with tech so i keep pushing for more knowlege started fully with Frontend Development, hopefully i can get there.
